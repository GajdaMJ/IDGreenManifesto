        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Our Manifesto is about the principles that we believe a chemical company must follow, simply as an extension of using scientific knowledge for the greater good. It is seen far too often that a company greenwashes their identity to misrepresent their actions, and it is this hypocrisy that we believe needs to be addressed. We must address and hold ourselves accountable as a society, as this is how we leave behind a habitable Earth for our future generations. Summarized in a quote by renowned American biologist Edward O. Wilson:</p>

        <p><em>“Science and technology are what we can do; morality is what we agree we should or should no do.”</em></p>

        <h2>What is Greenwashing?</h2>
        <p>Greenwashing is a form of advertising used by companies to falsely exaggerate their actions as more environmentally responsible than they are. This can take place through the use of deceptive marketing strategies, or misleading statements that fail to reflect meaningful change made by the company. Companies can adopt a greener colour scheme or include environmental buzzwords that appeal towards a positive response from the public, rather than making a contribution towards a more sustainable world.</p>
