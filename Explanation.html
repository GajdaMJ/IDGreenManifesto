        <h2>Manifesto Argumentation</h2>
        <p>The assignment for the manifesto requires us to critically reflect on sustainability, and build an argumentation to address this vision, due to which we find it important to critically examine the chemical industry, a field that plays a crucial role in developing the systems and processes that shape how the world functions.</p>

        <p>As chemical engineers, it is one's duty to educate oneself for the sake of helping shape a better and more sustainable planet for future generations. It is this intrinsic drive to shape our education in a way that helps us achieve this goal that led to us scrutinizing how exactly, in an ideal world, we would like chemical industries to operate. This led to the discovery of an unfortunate pattern seen across various chemical companies claiming to push the envelope regarding sustainable practices, which was that of corporate greenwashing. With such a seemingly apparent problem visible, it was the grou's pursuit of transparency that led to the genesis of our Manifesto, the FauxEco webpage.</p>

        <p>The webpage opens with a brief introduction into what the Manifesto stands for, and contextualizes the concept of greenwashing for those unfamiliar with this niche abstraction. Scrolling on, the viewer is greeted in big bold green letters by the principles of our manifesto, statements that we consider as tenets for any self-proclaimed sustainable chemical companies to abide by. The statements will be expanded below, as follows:</p>
        <p>We believe any chemical company MUST:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Advertise Truthfully</strong>
                <p>The company must advertise their efforts with the utmost transparency, and disclose progress reports of efforts spent on transitioning from their current practices to a more carbon neutral setting.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Collaborate responsibly</strong>
                <p>The company must be willing to stand by their actions and hold other companies and coalitions accountable for the same, conducting business with parties that adhere to sustainable principles. This fosters an environment where environmental target driven initiatives are encouraged and incentivized by means of collaboration.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Demonstrate an active and sustained effort to follow UN Sustainable Development Goals</strong>
                <p>The company must pick certain goals from the list of the 17 United Nation's Sustainable Development goals, and publicly track their progress through navigating their contribution to achieving these goals. Examples of goals that fit the title of a sustainable chemical company include Affordable and Clean Energy, Responsible Consumption and Production, as well as Climate Action (THE 17 GOALS | Sustainable Development, n.d.).</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Incorporate principles of green chemistry into the core of their mission statement</strong>
                <p>The company must adhere to as many of the 12 principles of Green Chemistry as possible. These are tenets developed in 1998 by Anastas and Warner, and these act as a framework for institutions and companies to develop a greener process, chemical or product (12 Principles of Green Chemistry - American Chemical Society, n.d.). Rigid guidelines to be followed that we believe pertain specifically to the focus of this manifesto are the design of safer chemicals, the use of safer solvents and auxiliaries, an in-depth analysis for pollution prevention and the use of safer chemistry for accident prevention.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Acknowledge past failures, and aim to proceed constructively</strong>
                <p>This is the most challenging tenet of the manifesto to adhere to, yet the most important. The company must acknowledge past failures, and utilize it as a launchpad to improve upon their products, services and their respective approaches. This must be done by the publication of efforts being taken to prevent past policy failures from reoccurring, explicitly stating their responsibility to contribute to a greener future. This report must be audited by a neutral third party.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>This is followed by a visual of the aforementioned 12 principles of green chemistry, as a means of visual input for the inquisitive viewer, curious about what frameworks already exist to hold chemical services or companies accountable. It is the combination of the framework provided by our manifesto and the 12 principles that has the ability to lead a paradigm shift throughout various industries, with the adequate implementation as a means of holding chemical companies strictly liable for their actions.</p>

        <p>Once the viewer scrolls down further, they see a link allowing access to a carbon footprint calculator. Once clicked upon, the website navigates to a page with a calculator programmed by the group. The guide provides instructions for the viewer on how to operate the calculator, and the user is able to select options pertaining to their own choices to determine how sustainable their lives truly are. The user will quickly realize that regardless of the options they pick, their actions will be labelled as unsustainable. The error statement, "Error: Your behavior is unsustainable. Do better.", serves to illustrate the common behavior of companies to shift the blame from the company onto the consumer. This practice illustrates how many companies refuse to take responsibility for their unsustainable actions while simultaneously encouraging consumers to act sustainably  and purchase carbon credits. Upon scrolling down further, there is a rationale contextualizing this thought experiment for the user, explaining the origin of the carbon footprint calculator, highlighting it as one of the original greenwashing efforts of a chemical corporate giant.</p>

        <p>The motivation behind the inclusion of the calculator was to contrast the initial argumentation of the manifesto with a clear example of corporate hypocrisy to demonstrate the urgency with which our manifesto must be followed. Designed as a provocative means of awareness, this reinforces the importance of holding chemical companies accountable for their actions, for the reader.</p>

        <p>The medium is however not limited to simple text, as the design communicates the overall message in an implicit manner. Upon opening the website, the viewer is immediately greeted with the name FauxEco.com, a rhyming wordplay on the focus of this project, where the colour palette refers to the pretence of green initiatives by big conglomerates. The logo supports this message, with the visual of an iceberg gradating from a healthy white and green to a gloomy brown, acting as a metaphor for the dark side of the chemical industry, which can also be interpreted as a reference to murky waters after an oil spill, an example of a possible accident that aligns with our 5th tenet. The green to brown ombre in the background of the website presents a complementary narrative, representing how glamourous the environmental efforts of green chemical companies appear to be on the surface, whereupon the prying eye is quick to discover that the truth behind such initiatives is often of an ominous nature.</p>
